# Migratron

Migratron is an open source project for performing and tracking migrations for Hive, Presto and Postgres.

## Configuration

To use Migratron, you need to specify the paths to your `.sql` files in [migration_paths.sh](./migration_path.sh) and override the volume to point to them (see [here](../README.md#using-with-other-projects)).
